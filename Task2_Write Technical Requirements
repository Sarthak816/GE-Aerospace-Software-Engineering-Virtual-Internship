TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPPLY CHAIN FEATURE:

Business Requirements:

The system must recommend the best time to order new plane parts by considering factors such as the part's last replacement date, the average replacement interval, and estimated shipping duration.
Order timings should be optimized to prevent shortages while keeping inventory costs minimal.

Machine Learning:

A machine learning model should be implemented to predict the ideal order time for plane parts. This model should be trained using historical data, including:
Last replacement date of the part.
Average time between replacements.
Estimated shipping duration.

Data Access:

The system must have access to all necessary data, including:                                       Last replacement date.                                                                                                   Average replacement interval.                                                                                     Estimated shipping time.
Data should be updated regularly to maintain accurate predictions.

Key Metrics:

To prevent shortages, the system must track and reduce instances where demand surpasses supply. This can be assessed by monitoring:

The frequency of stock-outs over a period.
Lead times (from order placement to delivery) compared to expected usage rates.

2. The system must optimize inventory management by reducing excess stock while ensuring availability. This can be evaluated using:

Inventory turnover ratio (how often stock is used and replenished).
Carrying cost of inventory (total storage expenses).
Fill rate (percentage of demand fulfilled by available stock).

3. The systemâ€™s performance should be measured using:

Accuracy of predicted order times.
Number of shortages despite system recommendations.
Cost savings achieved by following the suggested order schedule.

Design and Implementations:

The system must feature a user-friendly interface that clearly presents recommended order times.
Users should be able to input new data and modify existing records.
The system should efficiently process large datasets and provide accurate predictions in a timely manner
